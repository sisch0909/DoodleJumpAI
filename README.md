# DoodleJumpAI
Student project to create an AI for a DoodleJump-like game.

## Usage
There are 2 folders in this project which both contain the game.
In both folders you have to run DoodleJump.py.
The only difference is, that in the "game"-version the player can play the game using the arrow-keys, whereas in the "ai_game"-verison an AI is trained using a genetic algorithm and a neural network.
